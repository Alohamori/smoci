    tables:
      bonus_points:
        columns:
          ?: This table exists to account for the handful of occasions on which Victoria has unilaterally awarded points for quiz-adjacent reasons.
      connequences:
        columns:
          kind: indicates whether the question occurred during the Connections (🧩) or Sequences (🔢) round.
          '! (novelty)': 🖼 for picture questions, 𝄞 for music; links directly to relevant media on OCDB if applicable
          clues: Some effort has been made to display the clues as they were presented on the show, but approximations abound.
          points: A value of -1 is used to indicate that a bonus point was awarded to the other team.
          time: |-
            obtained by measuring the time-elapsed bar once it stopped progressing
            The value 40 is reserved for the handful of occasions on which the team was allowed to answer despite the buzzer having sounded.
        sortable_columns: [id, match, team, clues, connection, points, time]
      matches:
        columns:
          S (series): A value of 0 is used as a catch-all for specials.
          card: Teams are arranged by order of introduction,
            which doesn't always align with the official episode title.
          coin: The absolute value indicates which team went first,
            with a negative value signifying that it was at the other team's behest.
          LC (lead changes): For the purpose of determining this value, ties constitute
            lead changes and Connecting Wall points are distributed in three stages.
          matchup: sorted alphabetically to facilitate rematch discovery
        label_column: card
      matchups:
        label_column: label
      round_scores:
        columns:
          cum_score: cumulative score at the end of the round
      teams:
        columns:
          series: Teams are distinct over name and series to account for the occasional recycled name,
            but also to distinguish between regular matches and specials.
      vowel_clues:
        columns:
          right: contains multiple contestants in cases where they gave the correct answer more or less in unison
          wrong: includes contestants who buzzed in without giving an answer (thus costing their team a point), as well as those who tried unsuccessfully for the second-chance point
        label_column: clue
      vowel_sets:
        columns:
          team: A nonnull value here indicates that the team "owned" this set, having correctly answered all four clues in a full round.
          sweeper: the contestant, if any, that participated in the provision of every answer in a full round
          clean: When there's a sweeper, a value of 1 here indicates that they did so "cleanly", having provided every correct answer alone.
        label_column: category
      walls:
        columns:
          lives: |-
            the number of "lives" remaining when the team either solved the wall or ran out of time
            A null value here is distinct from 0, signifying that the team was unable to narrow the wall down to two groups.
          time: nonnull only when the team was able to find all four groups; useful for distinguishing between solved and unsolved walls
          PG: link to this wall as a PuzzGrid
